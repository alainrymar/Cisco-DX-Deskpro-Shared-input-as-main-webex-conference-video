# Cisco-DX-Deskpro-Shared-input-as-main-webex-conference-video

You may need to transmit the shared content of a Cisco DX or Webex DeskPro as the main video source in your Webex Meeting to get the Full video capacity in your conference.
This may be used for training purpose when a user wants to show something that comes from an external video source (microscope, telescope, video mixer, ...) and expect to have the full 
video capacity offered by the conferenceing plateform (Like Full HD, 30Fps).

This script reroute the shared content as the main video source that reaches the conferencing plateform (eg: Webex).
You get the Script that needs to be uploaded in the Video system (DX/WebexDeskPro) and the XML file that creates the new panel containing the 2 user buttons.
